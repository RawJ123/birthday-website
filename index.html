    <h1>🎉 Happy Birthday Palak🎉</h1>
    <p class="message">
      Today is special because <strong>you</strong> are special 💕
     Extra special because it’s the day you were born. I just want you to know how much your presence brightens everything around you. Your smile, your kindness, and the little things you do mean more than you probably realize. I hope this birthday brings you as much happiness as you bring to others. I’m really grateful that you exist, and I hope today reminds you how special you truly are 💖.
